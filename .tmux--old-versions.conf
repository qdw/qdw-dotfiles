# ~/.tmux.conf
# Adapted from a sample tmux.conf by Tyler Mulligan. Public domain.
#
# This configuration file binds many of the common GNU screen key bindings to
# appropriate tmux key bindings. Note that for some key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue and also that this set omits binding some commands available in
# tmux but not in screen.
#
# Note this is a good starting point but you should check out the man page
# for more configuration options if you really want to get more out of tmux.
